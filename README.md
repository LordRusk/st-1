Description
-----------
This patch allows the user to specify two distinct opacity values; one for the focused- and one for
unfocused windows' background.
This enables the user to spot the focused window at a glance.

The *Alpha Highlight Focus Patch* patch is based on the
[Alpha Patch](https://st.suckless.org/patches/alpha/),
which is already applied in the patch file below. Most of the work has been performed by the
original authors of the Alpha Patch.

More information on the patch can be found at the [release page](https://github.com/juliusHuelsmann/st/releases).

The patch is developped at [this  branch](https://github.com/juliusHuelsmann/st/tree/plainAlphaPatchV1).
